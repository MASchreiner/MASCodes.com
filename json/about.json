            "I am an aspiring web application developer born, raised, and currently living in Clearwater, FL. When I'm not studying programming I enjoy playing video games, studying and investing in the stock market, and spending time with family, friends, and my dog. On the rare occassion I get the chance to, I really enjoy being in the wilderness.",
            "Learning to program is the most fulfilling ambition of my life. I didn't always know this is what I wanted to do, but it almost seems inevitable looking back on a life-long love of mathematics and problem solving. My favorite languages so far are C# .NET and JavaScript with AngularJS, but I'm eager to learn more and challenge myself in new environments.",
            "I am currently looking for an internship writing web-based applications. Please email me and request my resume if you or someone you know is interested in working with me."
