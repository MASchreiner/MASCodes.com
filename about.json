            "I am a software developer born, raised, and currently living in Clearwater, FL. When I'm not studying programming I enjoy playing video games, studying and investing in the stock market, and spending time with family, friends, and my dog. On the rare occassion I get the chance to, I really enjoy being in the wilderness.",
            "Learning to program has been the most fulfilling ambition of my life. I didn't always know this is what I wanted to do, but it almost seems inevitable reflecting on my love of mathematics and problem solving. The more I learn, the more I want to learn more."
